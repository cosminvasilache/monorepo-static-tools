## TODO

- [ ] add video source selector
- [ ] fix `START` button smashing race condition, leaking `MediaStream`s
- [ ] fix `START` & `STOP` buttons both displaying before state is being computed
  - prefer not to hard code initial state
- [ ] style controlls to be less bad
- [ ] move logger

Ideas:

- [ ] don't show video source selector if there is only one source ???
